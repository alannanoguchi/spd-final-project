SPD 1.2 UI/UX Project Assignment
Assignment: Working with a buddy, each person builds their own realistic, dynamic prototype of the front end of their own creative mobile or web product. 

Requirements: The project must follow UX and UI conventions. 3 polished pages minimum. Any bending or breaking convention should be done thoughtfully. You must use a design framework such as Bootstrap for web, or mobile products will use Appleâ€™s conventional design components.

For this project, I designed an online class version of Make School. The purpose of this site is to allow students attend class online.
